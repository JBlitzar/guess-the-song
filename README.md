It will request oath scope access using the Spotify API. Go ahead and click through. Then select which option you want. Finally, click start. The instructions should take you from there.

## AI

I mostly didn't use AI when developing this project. At the end, I wanted to add a feature where you can change the source, and I used AI for that.
